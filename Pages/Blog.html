                Many organizations rely on external partners (or ‘intermediaries’) to support “their” customer experiences. But is it really “their” customer and “their” experience? Isn’t shared responsibility intrinsic to partnership? To be successful, the short answer is yes.

                This scenario may be imagined, but it certainly represents a common experience for many customers who do research on a brand’s website but end up buying from a retail partner. For Amy, the quality of her end-to-end customer journey depends on both the brand and the retail partner.

                As a business owner or manager, it's vital to make sure your employees feel properly recognized for all the hard work they do day in and day out. When workers see that there's more to getting the job done than simply receiving a pat on the back, they are often inspired to work harder, especially if there are incentives involved.

                This kind of engagement is invaluable to meeting and exceeding individual and collective goals, and keeping the whole company's bottom line going strong. One idea that may help your business stay on a course for success is hosting an awards ceremony every so often - be it every month, once a quarter or annually. This typically ensures people are not only being recognized and rewarded for their hard work, but that everyone in attendance really gets a feel for the kind of high-quality work winners put in.
